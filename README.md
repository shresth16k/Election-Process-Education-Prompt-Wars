## What is this?

India runs the largest democratic election on Earth. Yet millions of first-time voters walk into a polling booth having never read a single line of Election Commission documentation — because it's 200 pages of bureaucratic language buried in government PDFs.

**E-Process Ed** tears that wall down. It turns dense ECI guidelines into an interactive, AI-powered, multilingual civic education platform — built with a bold Neobrutalist UI that commands the same attention democracy deserves.

## Features

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AI` | **Civic Assistant** | Gemini 2.5 Flash, hard-scoped to ECI guidelines. No hallucinations, no off-topic drift. |
| `UX` | **Election Journey** | Scroll-triggered, `framer-motion` animated timeline of the complete voting process. |
| `i18n` | **Language Portal** | 10+ Indian languages via a custom-built persistent selector — not a browser plugin. |
| `CTA` | **Voter Onboarding** | 5-step guide for first-time voters that lands directly on the official NVSP Form 6. |
| `EDU` | **Knowledge Quiz** | Interactive voter literacy test with dynamic progress and instant feedback. |
| `UI` | **Neobrutalist Design** | Hard borders, offset shadows, neon accents. High-contrast, WCAG AA compliant. |
